Lagoon is a dynamic, weakly-typed and minimal scripting language. It draws inspiration from a handful of modern languages including JavaScript, Rust and PHP.

If you want to learn more about the language itself, you can read the [SPECIFICATION](./SPECIFICATION.md) or take a look at the collection of [examples](./examples) in this repository.

## Theory

Lagoon parses a string of source code into a token stream and [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

The generated AST is then passed to an interpreter. It uses a tree-walk approach to recursively iterate through each node in the tree.

> A tree-walk interpreter is one of the slowest methods of execution, but it's also one of the simplest. In the future Lagoon will likely move to a bytecode interpreter but whilst the language itself is still in early development, a tree-walk interpreter will continue to be used.

At the highest level, all operations in Lagoon are parsed as statements. A statement can contain one or more expressions. Those expressions are generally used to manipulate the execution environment and provide information to your script.

## Development Checklist

Lagoon is nowhere near being feature complete or syntax complete. Below is a small checklist of things that we still need to add and design before marking it as "stable".

* [x] `&&`, `||` - Boolean infix operators
* [x] `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` - Mathematical comparison operators
* [x] `**` - Exponent / power operator
* [ ] `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` - Bitwise operators
* [x] Lists
* [x] `for..in` statements
* [x] `in`, `not in` operators
* [ ] Scalar objects (methods on scalar types)
* [ ] Module system
* [x] Standard Library
* [ ] Nicer error reporting
* [ ] Transpile to JavaScript (self-hosted)
* [x] Nicer command-line interface
